// SendRequest abstracts the logic every subclient uses to send a request and
// receive the corresponding response.
//
// To get the response for a sent request, we can just read the next response
// from our channel. This works fine in a single-threaded context, and the
// message IDs of both the sent request and response should match. In
// a concurrent context, this isn't necessarily true, but since
// gorilla/websocket doesn't handle concurrency (it'll panic; see
// https://github.com/gorilla/websocket/issues/119), who cares?
//
// Technically a request ID and response ID mismatch could happen if the server
// processes requests in a different order it received them (e.g. we should 1,
// then 2; but it processes 2, and then 1), then yeah... there'll be an error.
// We could add a mutex wrapping sending our request and reading from the
// channel, but I personally haven't experienced this yet, so
//
// It should be noted multiple connections to the server are totally fine.
// Phrased differently, mesasge IDs are unique per client. Moreover, events will
// be broadcast to every client.
