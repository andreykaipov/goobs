//
// To get the response for a sent request, we can just read the next response
// from our channel. This works fine in a single-threaded context, and the
// message IDs of both the sent request and response should match.
//
// In a concurrent context, this isn't necessarily true, but since
// gorilla/websocket doesn't handle concurrency anyways, who cares? We could
// technically add a mutex in between sending our request and reading from the
// channel, but ehh...
//
// Interestingly, it does seem thread-safe if I use a totally different
// connection, in that connection A won't get a response from OBS for a request
// from connection B. So, message IDs must be unique per client? More
// interestingly, events appear to be broadcast to every client, maybe because
// they have no associated message ID?
